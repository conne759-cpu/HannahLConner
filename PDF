INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE THE CORRECT PDF:

1. Open resume_template.html in your web browser
2. Press Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on Mac) to print
3. In the print dialog:
   - Change the destination to "Save as PDF"
   - Make sure margins are set to "Default" or "Normal"
   - Click "Save"
4. Save the file as "resume.pdf" in your "files" folder
5. This will replace the current incorrect files/resume.pdf

Alternatively, if you prefer to use an online converter:
1. Go to an HTML to PDF converter website (like html-pdf.com or convertio.co)
2. Upload the resume_template.html file
3. Convert and download the PDF
4. Save it as "resume.pdf" in your "files" folder

This will ensure the PDF contains the same content as your resume.png image and the HTML resume page.
