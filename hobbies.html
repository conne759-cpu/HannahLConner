                        <h3>A Heartwarming Choir Memory 💝</h3>
                        <p>My 8th grade select choir was very important to me and the director, Seth Gregory, was one of those teachers who you never forget. He was one of those teachers who you know are there for YOU and you can always go to and count on. He made class very special, and because of that I wanted to do something for him.</p>
                        <p>I got together with my classmates, and together we planned a surprise for him. We had a teacher distract him while we got to work, throwing streamers all over the room and blowing up balloons. When he walked into the classroom, we screamed, surprise! Then, the first chords of Count on Me by Bruno Mars started playing, and while we sang this song to our beloved choir director, each of us stepped up and handed him a rose. We also all had gifts and cards for him and his new baby which was on the way. I will never forget seeing the tears roll down his face and the warm feeling embracing all of us.</p>

                        <h3>The Magic of Music & Theater 🎵</h3>
                        <p>Choir and theater have been a very important aspect of my life because I have made so many memories and met so many amazing people. There was a study in 2013 that found that when people sing together, their heartbeats actually synchronize. This is the perfect way to describe how choir/theater has felt for me, you feel so close to that group of people because they are your family. I have been a part of many groups over the years, and they all have a special place in my heart for different reasons.</p>

                        <h3>My Swimming Journey 🏊‍♀️</h3>
                        <p>Swimming was another family for me, but it was a bit different because the sport pushes your mind and body in a different way. I had never considered myself to be an athletic person before I joined swimming in my freshman year of high school, but over the next three years, I was able to push myself in ways I never thought possible.</p>
                        <p>There were some mornings I had to drag myself out of bed and struggled to jump into that cold water at 5:15am, but I did it over and over and over again until I was able to achieve a level of greatness within myself which I will always be proud of.</p>
